This repo contains code I wrote for Morehouse College's AI course under Dr. Amos Johnson Jr, PhD. The assignment was to solve a sudoku board using a search algorithm. The backtracking code uses a simple backtracking algorithm to reach the solution. The min-conflicts code is not functioning properly yet but aims to implement a minimum conflicts heuristic to reach the solution using local search.
